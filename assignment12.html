   <h4>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha kingdom of India. <br/>The kingdom's security was entirely based on religious tolerance and <br/>the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus.</h4>
<p class="highlight">
    Shivaji Maharaj who was the descendant of a line of prominent nobles was very brave and fought many wars to consolidate India.<br/> At that time, India was under the Muslim rulers and divided.<br/> The Mughals were in north India and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur as well as of Golconda in the south of India.</p>
    <h4>The ancestral estates of Shivaji Maharaj were situated in the Deccan region in the realm of Bijapur sultans. <br/>He found the suppression of the Muslim rulers and the persecution of all the Hindus in the region.<br/> He was sad due to the devastating condition of the Hindus that by the age of 16 he convinced himself to be the cause of the Hinduâ€™s freedom.<br/> It was a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his whole life.</h4>
